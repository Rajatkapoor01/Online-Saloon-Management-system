Men Online Salon Management System
Project Overview
The Men Online Salon Management System is a web-based application developed primarily using PHP. The system streamlines salon operations by allowing administrators to manage services, staff, appointments, and customer interactions. The application includes two main interfaces: an admin portal for managing the system and a view portal for customers to book appointments and view services.
